    \item {Design and implemented a autograd engine with Numpy that is able has accuracy within 2\% of Pytorch's implementation.}
    \item {Implemented the engine in Python, incorporating key mathematical concepts for efficient gradient computation. Improved gradient computation performance by over 50x from original naive implementation.}
    \item {Managed a 5-mem}
	\end{cvitems}
